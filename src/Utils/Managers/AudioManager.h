/**
 * Utility Class to be extended by Managers that handle some kind of audio
 * (such as music or sound effects).
 * 
 * These two are handled separately because they have different use cases.
 * Music can only play one track at a time, while sound effects can play
 * multiple at once. This changes the logic of how they are handled.
